# AWS EC2 Website Hosting Project

This project demonstrates how to host multiple static websites on a single Amazon EC2 instance using Apache (`httpd`). It includes configuration for serving one site on the default HTTP port (80) and another on a custom port (8080), without interfering with each other.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Platform:** Amazon EC2 (Amazon Linux 2)
- **Web Server:** Apache HTTP Server
- **Languages:** HTML
- **Ports Used:**
  - Port 80 → Main Website
  - Port 8080 → Secondary Website

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance
- Selected Amazon Linux 2 AMI
- Enabled ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 8080 (Custom TCP) in Security Group

### 2. Install Apache
```bash (if you are working as a root user no need to use SUDO)
 yum update -y
 yum install httpd -y
 Service httpd start
 Service httpd status

3. Host Main Website (Port 80)
- Edited /var/www/html/index.html with custom HTML content

4. Host Second Website (Port 8080)
- Created /var/www/html8080/index.html
- Modified /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to:
Listen 8080

Adding this Listen is bottom of the conf file.
<VirtualHost *:8080>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html8080"
    ServerName localhost
    <Directory "/var/www/html8080">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

- Restarted Apache:
sudo systemctl restart httpd



🌐 Accessing the Websites
- Main Site: http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
- Second Site: http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080
